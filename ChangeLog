	* Removed rawip-scan-engine.c and rawip-scan-engine.h.  Code moved to
          tcp-scan.c and definitions to tcp-scan.h

	* New source file: utils.c, containing utility functions.

2007-12-21 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Converted tcp-scan to GPL license.  Previous versions were
	  NTA Monitor internal use only.

	  Added GPL text to beginning of all source files and to
	  --version output.

	  Added files AUTHORS, ChangeLog, NEWS, README and TODO.

	  Removed unneeded files random.c, generic-ip-scan.c and
	  generic-ip-scan.h.

	  Removed variables "scanner_name" and "scanner_version" and replaced
	  with PACKAGE_STRING.

	  Removed DNS lookup for tcp-scan-target.

	  Removed syslog code.  We don't use this any more, and I doubt that
	  anyone else needs it.

	  configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.13
