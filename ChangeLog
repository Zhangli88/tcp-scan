	* configure.ac: incremented version number to 1.16.
	  First beta test version for DK, DC & AP.

2008-07-11 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* tcp-scan.c: Removed reference to RMIF environment variable.
	  tcp-scan now uses the value specified with --interface, or
	  if that is not specified, picks an interface with
	  pcap_lookupdev().

2008-02-04 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* tcp-scan.c: Improved get_source_ip function: close socket descriptor
	  after use, and give better error message if the interface has no
	  IP address.

	* tcp-scan.c: Added new --port (-p) option to replace the now
	  depreciated --data (-D) option.

	* tcp-scan.c: Modified usage() so that it can output either brief or
	  detailed help output depending on a new "detailed" argument.  Now,
	  detailed output, including information on the available options, is
	  only displayed when ike-scan is run with the --help option.  For
	  error conditions such as incorrect options, it only produces brief
	  output.

	* tcp-scan.c: Added --servicefile2 (-E) option to allow the TCP service
	  filename to be specified.

	* configure.ac: Increment version number to 1.15.

2008-02-04 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac, tcp-scan.h: Add Posix regular expression support with
	  header file regex.h.

	* configure.ac: Increment version number to 1.14.

	* tcp-scan.c: Improved algorithm to create port name map from
	  services file.  This new algorithm uses Posix regex functions.

	* tcp-scan-services: Improved port list in services file.

2007-12-31 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* tcp-scan.c: Use mersenne twister PRNG to generate random values
	  for seq_no, ack_no and source_port rather than using an md5 hash.

	* md5.c, md5.h: Source files removed as they are no longer needed.

	* tcp-scan.h: Removed include for md5.h.

	* tcp-scan-services: New TCP services file.

	* tcp-scan.c: Use TCP service file in DATADIR rather than using hard-
	  coded absolute path.

	* tcp-scan.1: New manpage file.

2007-12-24 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Removed rawip-scan-engine.c and rawip-scan-engine.h.  Code moved to
          tcp-scan.c and definitions to tcp-scan.h

	* New source file: utils.c, containing utility functions.

	* Added mt19937ar.c: mersenne twister PRNG.
	  Changed random number implementation to use the mersenne twister
	  functions from mt19937ar.c rather than random() from the C
          library.  This improves portability, as random() is not part of
          standard C.

	* Removed unneeded --protocol (-p) option.

        * configure.ac: Added checks for strlcat and strlcpy, with
          replacement functions using the OpenBSD implementations if they are
          not present.

        * strlcat.c, strlcpy.c: New source files from the OpenBSD source at
          http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/string

	* *.c: replaced calls to strcat and strncat with strlcat, and
          calls to strcpy and strncpy with strlcpy.

	* configure.ac, tcp-scan.h: Added checks for headers sys/ioctl.h,
	  net/if.h and sys/utsname.h, and made these conditional includes.

	* tcp-scan.h, tcp-scan.c: Change structure definitions to
          typedefs.  i.e. change "struct foo {defs};" to
          typedef struct {defs} foo;".

	* tcp-scan.c: Removed unneeded Gettimeofday() call in
	  add_host_port().

	* tcp-scan.c: Change calls to strtol() to use the new
          wrapper function Strtol() instead, because this checks for
          errors.  Previously, a non-numeric value would be converted to
          zero without any error, meaning something like "--snap=xxx"
          would be silently accepted.  Now such invalid inputs results in
          an error.

2007-12-21 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Converted tcp-scan to GPL license.  Previous versions were
	  NTA Monitor internal use only.

	  Added GPL text to beginning of all source files and to
	  --version output.

	  Added files AUTHORS, ChangeLog, NEWS, README and TODO.

	  Removed unneeded files random.c, generic-ip-scan.c and
	  generic-ip-scan.h.

	  Removed variables "scanner_name" and "scanner_version" and replaced
	  with PACKAGE_STRING.

	  Removed DNS lookup for tcp-scan-target.

	  Removed syslog code.  We don't use this any more, and I doubt that
	  anyone else needs it.

	  configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.13
